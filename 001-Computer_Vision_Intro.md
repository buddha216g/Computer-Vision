Making computer see!

Teaching computer to see has wide varieties of applications.

In the context of a self driving car, on seeing the below picture, the car has to know where the lanes are in order to navigate safely.

We will look at a few techniques to find lane lines.

## Techniques ##

 1. Color Thresholding
 
 2. Region Masking
 
 3. Canny Edge Detection
 
 4. Hough Transformation


### Color Thresholding ###

 - A colored image is made of a stack of 3 images, each corresponding to red, green and blue channels.
 
 - The above image can be split into three seperate images as shown below

 - An image is a matrix of pixels whose values range from 0 (dark) to 255 (white)
 
 - Since lanes are white markings on the road, these can be identified, by filtering out pixels less than a certain threshold. See output below.

 However, this does not fully solve our problem, because you can see other white spots that are not lanes.



### Region Masking ###

Assuming the camera that took pictures of the road is mounted on a fixed position in the front of the car, the lane lines will always appear around a general region of the image.

Applying that region of interest to the images (blue dotted region) , we are now able to eliminate non lane lines, as shown below.

However, under varying lighting conditions (day, night, shade etc) and lane colors (yellow etc) the two techniques we looked at so far, may fail to detect lanes. Hence the need for more sophisticated algorithms.



### Canny Edge Detection ###

Goal is to indentify edges of the following image.

Since we are only interested in finding edges, we first convert the colored image into a gray scale image.

An image is a mathematical function f(x,y) of pixels, so you can peform mathematical functions on it.
The brightness of each pixel corresponds to the strength of the gradient at that point. We find edge pixels by tracing out the pixels that follow the strongest gradients. By identifying edges, we can more easily detect objects by their shape.  The output of applying canny edge detection algorithm shows an image full of dots, that represent edges of lane lines as well as other objects.

### Hough Transformation ###

Since we are interested in finding lane lines, we can model a line and then fit that model to the assortment of dots, to detect lane lines.
To make it easier to work with lots of dots, we use hough space. A point in image space represents a line in the hough space and vice versa.
By using polar co-ordinates, a dot in image space is transformed (hough transformation) into sine curve in hough space.

Applying Hough transformation on the previous canny edge detected image, produced the following output.

## Results ##

Application of the above techniques resulted in the car accurately identifying lanes, as shown in the video below.
